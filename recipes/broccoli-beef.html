        <li>Thinly slice the flank steak against the grain and finely mince garlic.</li>

        <li>While the rice is cooking and meat is marinating, cut broccoli into bite-size pieces and slice 
            scallions at the diagonal into thick bite-sized pieces. Separate the white and green portions.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large pan over high heat. Once very hot, add the strips of marinated beef and scallion whites. 
            Flip after two minutes then remove after one additional minute, or until browned and fragrant.
